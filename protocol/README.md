## Wet lab protocols

1. [Primary PCR to amplify *trnL* (dietary plant DNA)](https://github.com/bpetrone/trnL-pipeline/blob/master/protocol/1_primary_pcr.md)   
2. [Dilution](https://github.com/bpetrone/trnL-pipeline/blob/master/protocol/2_dilution.md) 
3. [Indexing PCR](https://github.com/bpetrone/trnL-pipeline/blob/master/protocol/3_indexing_pcr.md) 

**Recommendations for sequencing**:
A 2x150bp (300 cycle) sequencing run guarantees sufficient overlap for assembly. A 2x75bp (150 cycle) run enables assembly of *trnL* reads from all but one food plant in the reference: the water chestnut *Eleocharis dulcis*, which has an unusually long 154 bp trnL-P6 sequence (7 standard deviations outside the mean reference sequence length).
