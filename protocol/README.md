## Wet lab protocols

1. [DNA extraction](https://github.com/bpetrone/trnL-pipeline/blob/master/protocols/1_dna_extraction.md) 
2. [Primary PCR to amplify *trnL* (dietary plant DNA)](https://github.com/bpetrone/trnL-pipeline/blob/master/protocols/2_primary_pcr.md)   
3. [Dilution](https://github.com/bpetrone/trnL-pipeline/blob/master/protocols/3_dilution.md) 
4. [Indexing PCR](https://github.com/bpetrone/trnL-pipeline/blob/master/protocols/4_indexing_pcr.md) 

**Recommendations for sequencing**:
A 2x150bp (300 cycle) sequencing run guarantees sufficient overlap for assembly. A 2x75bp (150 cycle) run enables assembly of *trnL* reads from all but one food plant in the reference: the water chestnut *Eleocharis dulcis*, which has an unusually long 154 bp trnL-P6 sequence (7 standard deviations outside the mean reference sequence length).
