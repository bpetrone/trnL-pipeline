# trnL-pipeline

This repository is designed to support assessment of plant dietary intake directly from human stool samples using DNA metabarcoding with the *trnL*-P6(UAA) marker<sup>[1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkl938)</sup>. It includes

- **An experimental protocol** to amplify *trnL* from DNA extracted from human fecal samples (details in trnL-pipeline/protocols)
- **A computational pipeline** to analyze high-throughput *trnL* amplicon sequencing data (in trnL-pipeline/pipeline)
- **A reference database** of *trnL* sequences for food plants used by humans to assign *trnL* reads to a plant taxon (in trnL-pipeline/reference)

These methods were developed by the [David Lab](http://el.ladlab.org:8080) at Duke University and accompany the manuscript "Diversity of plant DNA in stool is linked to dietary quality, age, and household income"<sup>[2](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.13.22276343v1)</sup>.
